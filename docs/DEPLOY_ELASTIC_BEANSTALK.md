# Deploying Java application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This document explains how to deploy the demo application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS Console.

### Step 1

Start by opening the AWS Console and navigate to **Elastic Beanstalk** (use the search bar in the navigation bar). Click on the **Create Application** button to start configuring the web app.

### Step 2

Choose a name for your application, e.g., "workshop-demo". You can leave Application Tags empty. In the **Platform** dropdown menu choose **Java**, for the **Platform branch** choose **Java (Corretto) 11**, and for the **Platform version** choose the **Recommended** option.

### Step 3

For the **Application code** choose **Upload your code**. In the following section fill in the **Version label** with a unique name for the version of your application code, e.g., "1.0.0". For the **Source code origin** choose **Local file** and upload the generated `.war` file. This file should be located inside of your project in the `/target` folder.

### Step 4

Click on **Create application** and wait until the application is created. This can take a couple of minutes.

### Step 5

Make sure that your application is deployed as a 'Single instance' instead of 'Load Balanced'. If it's not deployed as 'Single instance', it will start generating costs (which we want to avoid). The setting can be checked and updated by clicking on **Configuration**, and **Edit** in the **Capacity** row. The **Environment type** should be set as 'Single instance'. If it's not, update it and save the changes by clicking on the **Apply** button at the bottom of the page.

### Step 6

When the application is ready click on **Configuration**, and **Edit** in the **Database** row. Here you can configure a managed RDS Database for your application.
Choose one of the engines (for the workshop we will use **postgres**), fill in the **Username** and **Password** fields and leave all other fields with their
default values. Do not set your Username to _admin_ as it is a reserved user and database creation would fail.

Make sure that the **Instance class** is set to **db.t2.micro**. When everything is configured click on **Apply**. Database creation will
take a couple of minutes again.

### Step 7

When Elastic Beanstalk finishes with resource creations, in your AWS Console navigate to RDS service (In the navigation menu use the search bar and open the RDS in a new tab). On the left navigation menu click on **Databases** (under Dashboard) and you should see one instance of the database we just created. Click on the DB Identifier and copy the endpoint (e.g., bbpovxui5t2wjv.cwfniba4nd10.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com) â€” we will need it in the following step.

### Step 8

Now we need to tell our application how to connect to the database. In the Elastic Beanstalk menu, click on **<your-application>-env** and **Configuration**. In the Configuration tab click on the **Edit** button in the **Software** row. On the bottom of the page add the following environment variables (properties). Don't forget to use your values instead of values inside of `< >`.

```
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<database-endpoint>/postgres
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=<username>
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=<password>
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
SPRING_JPA_DATABASE_PLATFORM=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
SERVER_PORT=5000
```

The final result should look something like this

```
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://bbpovxui5t2wjv.cwfniba4nd10.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/postgres
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=workshop
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=mypassword
SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=update
SPRING_JPA_DATABASE_PLATFORM=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
SERVER_PORT=5000
```

Apply your changes by clicking on the **Apply** button.

### Step 9

Your application should be ready to go! Test it out by clicking on the **Go to environment** option in the left navigation menu, or by directly openning the application's endpoint.
